# Forza

#     Objective is to make calculations to find amount due
#
#    amount due is based on customer code, number of rental\
#    days, the odometer at the start, and the odometer at \
#    the end.
#
#    Program uses integers, condtions, input/outputs,\
#    and iterations
#
#    Finds the final amount due based on the input given
#
#    The first section of code is where the program gives\
#    the user a list of inputs that need to put in
#
#    The next section of code asked the user if they would\
#    like to continue 
#
#    If the user chose A the program would run through a\
#    series of calculations and inputs based on the\
#    customer code
#
#    If the program reviews an invalid customer code, an\
#    error message will print as well as another prompt
#
#    The program will run until the user does not want to\
#    continue
#
#    Program will print "Thank you for your loyalty!" at\
#    the end
